Tteokbokki is a popular Korean dish consisting of cylindrical rice cakes, typically 2-3 inches long, bathed in a vibrant red, glossy sauce. From a front-facing perspective, the rice cakes appear soft and chewy, with a slightly curved and smooth surface. The sauce clings to the rice cakes, providing a spicy sheen that contrasts with the stark white of the rice cakes. Often, fish cakes and scallions are interspersed, adding layers of texture and color. The dish is usually served hot, and you may depict a slight steam rising from the surface. The overall impression is one of bold color, tantalizing texture, and inviting warmth.
