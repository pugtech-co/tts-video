Khachapuri: A boat-shaped, golden-brown bread encases a filling of molten white cheese. In the center, a bright yellow, partially cooked egg yolk is nestled, with a small dollop of glistening butter atop it. The pointed ends of the bread are slightly crispy, and the dish is served hot, emitting a gentle steam. The rich textures and warm colors create an inviting and delectable appearance.
