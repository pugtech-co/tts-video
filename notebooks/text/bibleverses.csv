Jeremiah 5:22,"Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it. And do you not tremble before me?  And do you not tremble before me? And do you not tremble before me? And do you not tremble before me? And do you not tremble before me?",ocean_22s.mp4
